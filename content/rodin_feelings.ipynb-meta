Summary: Last week I visited the National Gallery in Washington, D.C. Among the pieces, there were several Rodin sculptures. While there's nothing remarkable about a gallery having such sculptures, seeing them gave me pause. I've seen Rodin's sculptures in Palo Alto, D.C., London and Paris, and there's never just one or two. Rodin was prolific. He was constantly cranking out sculptures. As I reflected on how many Rodin pieces, I had a though that many grad students in their late twenties like me have had. What am I doing with my life?
