<h1 id="Feelings-by-Rodin">Feelings by Rodin<a class="anchor-link" href="#Feelings-by-Rodin">¶</a></h1><p>Last week I visited the National Gallery in Washington, D.C. Among the pieces, there were several Rodin sculptures. While there's nothing remarkable about a gallery having such sculptures, seeing them gave me pause. I've seen Rodin's sculptures in Palo Alto, D.C., London and Paris, and there's never just one or two. Rodin was prolific. He was constantly cranking out sculptures. As I reflected on how many Rodin pieces, I had a though that many grad students in their late twenties like me have had. What am I doing with my life?</p>
<p>Having seen just how much Rodin did, I want to do more things. I want to produce more "pieces" for others to enjoy, discuss and learn from. In my day job as a graduate research assistant in physics, I produce occasional esoteric articles meant for a very small subset of people. These articles are infrequent, though, and go through multiple layers of revision between my mind and the reader's. This blog is my attempt to do more things -- to produce more for a wider audience.</p>
<p>Beyond this creative motivation, I am also trying to transition my career path toward data science. In my research, I analyze simulations of biopolymers (e.g, proteins and nucleic acids). The data sets from these simulations are often on the order of 100 gigabytes, and from working with these large data sets, I've found that I enjoy the analysis and coding parts of the work more than the physics parts. As I shift my thinking about and skills for dealing with data from a biophysics perspective to more of a data science perspective, I will record the journey here for your enjoyment -- and perhaps for the enjoyment of human resources personnel at companies seeking data scientists....<em>wink</em>.</p>
<h2 id="Feelings-by-other-artists">Feelings by other artists<a class="anchor-link" href="#Feelings-by-other-artists">¶</a></h2><p>I claim this blog is about data science, so this post needs some data analysis. Since Rodin made me feel lazy and uncreative, I'm curious what feelings art might be invoking in others. Twitter seems like a great source for human stream of consciousness data, so I'll request a stream of tweets labeled with the keyword "artists" and see what words are associated with such tweets. The python code here is adapted from a tutorial by The Data Incubator. You can watch that tutorial at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zfhc6GQ84e4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zfhc6GQ84e4</a> and download accompanying code from their repository <a href="https://github.com/thedataincubator/ds30">https://github.com/thedataincubator/ds30</a>.</p>
